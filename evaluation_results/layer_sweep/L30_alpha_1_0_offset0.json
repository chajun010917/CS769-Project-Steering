We can also use the fact that the difference between 11 and 10 is 1, and the difference between 121 and 100 is 21. So, the difference between the square root of 121 and the square root of 100 is 21/10 = 2.1. Since the square root of 102 is between 10 and the square root of101, the difference between the two square roots will be less than 2.1. However, we can approximate the square root of 103 as being 10.5, which is the average of 10 and 11. Then, the square root of 99 is 9.95, which is the average between 9 and 10. Using these approximations, we can estimate the square root of 98 as being 9.95 - 0.05 = 9.9, and the square root of97 as being 9.9 - 0.05= 9.85. Similarly, the square root of101 is 10.05, which is the average value between 10 and 10.1. Therefore, the square root of100 is 10, and the square rootof 99 is 9,95. The square root of 101 is 10.048, so the square root of 104 is 10.2. The square root of101 is between 10 and10.1, so the square rootof 101 is 10,048. The square root of100 is10, and the square roofof 99 is 9,.95. The square rootof 101is 10.048, and the square rooto f 104 is 10,2. The square rootof101 is between 10and 10.1, so we can approximate the square roofo f 101 as being 10.048. The square rootof100 is 10, so the square rooto f99 is 9.9.5. The square root of98 is 9.9 -0.05 =  9.9, so the square root o f97 is 9.9-0.05 = 99.85. The square root of99 is 9.99, so the square root 98 is 9.99 - 0.01 = 9.98.

It uses a 56-bit key, which is split into two parts: a 48-bit key for the expansion and a 8-bit parity bit for error detection.\n3. However, when we talk about the \"subkey\" in DES, it refers to the 48-bit key used for the substitution and permutation steps within the algorithm.\n\nGiven this information, the question asks for t"
