Plugging this into the original recurrence relation, we get A * 3^n - \\frac{5A}{6} * 3^{n - 1} + \\frac{A}{6} *3^{n - 2} = 3^n. Simplifying this expression, we get A *3^n - \\frac {5A}{6}3^n + \\frac{A} {6}3^n = 3^n. Combining like terms, we have \\frac{6A}{6}3^ n - \\frac{5 A}{6}3^n = \\frac{A}{3}3^n = 0. This implies that A = 0 or \\frac{A}{2} = 0. However, if A = 0, then the particular solution would be zero, which does not satisfy the given condition. Therefore, we must multiply our assumed particular solution by 3 to get y_p [n]  = 3A * 3^n. Now, plugging this into the original equation, we get 3A *  3^n - \\ frac{5}{6}3A * 3^{n-1} + \\frac {1}{6}3A*3^{n-2} = 3^ n. Simplifying this expression gives 3A * 9^n - \\frac{15}{6}A * 3^n + \\frac {1} {6}A * 9^n = 3^n. This can be further simplified to 27A * 3^n - 2.5A * 3^n  + \\frac{1} {6} A * 9^n =3^n. Combining the like terms, we get 27A *  3^ n - 2.5 A * 3^n + 1.5A *  3 ^n = 3^n. This implies that 26.5A * 9^n  = 3^n. Dividing both sides by 3^n, we get 26.5A = 1.
