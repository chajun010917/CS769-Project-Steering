The normal force (N) exerted by the surface, which is equal in magnitude to the weight of the box (mg).\n2. The force of kinetic friction (f_k), which opposes the motion of the box. The magnitude of f_k is given by \u03bcN = \u03bcmg.\n3. Gravity (mg), which acts downward but does not affect the horizontal motion of the box.\n\nSince the box is moving horizont"
