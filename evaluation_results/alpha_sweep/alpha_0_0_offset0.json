It uses a 56-bit key.\n\nIn DES, the key is divided into two parts: the key itself (56 bits) and a parity bit for each half of the key. However, when considering the effective key size used in the encryption process, we focus on the actual key bits.\n\nThe key is divided into 16 rounds, with each round using a different key. In each"
