Since the surfaces are ideal radiators, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for blackbody radiation. The total energy radiated per unit surface area of a blackbody per unit time is given by the Stefan-Beverwhere law: E = \u03c3T^4, where E is the energy radiated per unit area per unit time, and T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin. The total energy radiating from the two surfaces is given by the sum of the energy radiating from each surface. The energy radiating from the surface at 200K is 5.7W/m^2K * 200K = 1134 W/m^2, and the energy radiating from the 300K surface is 5.7 W/m^2K *300K = 1710 W/m^2. The net energy radiating from the warmer surface is the difference between these two values, which is 1710 - 1134 = 576 W/m^2.

When the reflection coefficient is equal to -1, the wave is completely reflected in phase, resulting in a pure standing wave.\n\n2.  The reflection coefficient is given by the formula: \n    R = (E1 / E) = (E1 / 5)\n\n3.  For a pure standing wave, R = -1. Therefore, E1 / 5 = -1, which gives us E1 = -5.\n\n4.
