The first step divides the list into two halves. Since the list has 120 elements, the first division would result in two halves of 60 elements each.\n2. In the next step, one of these halves is further divided into two, resulting in four quarters of 15 elements each.\n3. Then, one of these quarters is divided into two, resulting again in eight eighths of 7.5 elements each. However, since we can't divide an element, we round down to 7 elements per eighth.\n4. This process continues until the target value is located or it's determined that it's not in the list.\n\nThe maximum number of elements examined would be the sum of the elements in each half, quarter, eighth, etc., until the target value is either found or eliminated. \n\nIn this case, the sequence would be:\n- 120 (initial list)\n- 60 (first division)\n- 30 (second division)\n- 15 (third division)\n- 7 (fourth division)\n\nAdding these numbers together gives us 120 + 60 + 30 + 15 + 7 = 232. However, this counts the total number of elements examined if the target value was found at the last step. If the target value is not in the first half of the list, we only examine the second half, then the quarter, then the eighth, and so on. \n\nHowever, the question asks for the maximum number of elements examined, which would occur if the target value is at the very end of the list. Therefore, we should consider the number of elements examined up to the point where the target value is eliminated, which is the last division before the target value is known to not be in the list.\n\nSince the list is sorted, if the target value is not found in the first half, it will be in the second half. If it's not in the second half, it will be eliminated in the third division, and so on. The maximum number of elements examined is therefore the sum of the elements up to the last division before the elimination, which is 120 + 60 = 180. However, this is still not correct because we have to account for the divisions after the initial 60 elements.\n\nThe correct approach is to realize that binary search eliminates half of the remaining elements at each step. So, the maximum number of elements is the sum of the powers of 2 up to the point where we eliminate all but one element. \n\nThe powers of 2 up until 120 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128. Adding these together gives us 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 255. However, this counts all the elements that could potentially be examined, not just the maximum number of elements in each division.\n\nTo find the maximum number in each division, we need to consider the number of elements in each half, starting from the initial list of 120 elements. \n\n- 120 / 2 = 60\n- 60 / 2 = 30\n- 30 / 2 = 15\n- 15 / 2 = 7.5, rounded down to 7\n- 7 / 2 = 3.5, rounded down is not needed here as we're looking for the maximum number of divisions, not the actual number of elements in each.\n\nHowever, we made a mistake in our previous steps.

We know the total amount borrowed is $4,000 and it will be repaid over 3 years. To find the monthly payment, we can use the formula for the future value of an annuity, but since we're solving for the monthly payment, we'll use the formula:\n\nPMT = P x r x (1 + r)^n / ((1 + r)^n - 1)\n\nWhere:\n- PMT is the periodic payment\n- P is the principal (initial amount borrowed) = $4,000\n- r is the periodic interest rate = 0.005\n- n is the number periods = 36 months\n\nPMT = 4000 x 0.005 x (1 + 0.005)^36 / ((1 + 0.05)^36 - 1)\nPMT ≈ 4000 x  0.005 x 1.1959 / 5.4186\nPMT ≈ 40000 x 0.0010959 / 5.4196\nPMT ≈ $80.19\n\nNow that we have the monthly payment, we need to find the present value (PV) using the formula:\n\nPV = PMT * [(1 - (1+r)^(-n)) /r]\nPV = 80.19 * [(1 - ( 1+0.005)^(-36)) / 0.005]\nPV = 80 * [(1 - 0.6767) / 0.005] \nPV = 80 * (0.3233 / 0.005)\nPV = 80 * 64.66\nPV = $5188.80\n\nHowever, this is not among the options provided.

Since the interest is compounded monthly, we need to convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate and the time from years to months.\n\nThe annual interest rate is 1/2%, which is 0.5%/year or 0.005 as a decimal.

This means that x moles of N_2 will also react to form NH_3. The number of moles of NH_3 formed will be 2x (since 1 mole of N2 forms 2 moles of NH_ 3).\n\nThe equilibrium concentrations can be expressed as:\n[N_2] = 0 - x = -x (since 1 - x moles of N2 remain)\n[H_2] =  3 - x\n[NH_3] = 2x\n\nSubstituting these values into the equilibrium constant expression:\n\nK = (2x)^2 / ((-x) * (3-x)^3)\n\nSince K is very small, we can assume that x is much smaller than 3, so (3-x) ≈ 3. Therefore:\n\nK = (2^2)x^2 / (-x * 3^3)\nK = (4/27)x^2 / (-1 * x)\nK = -(4/27)x\n\nNow, substitute the value of K:\n\n-(4/27)x = 2.38 * 10^-14\n\nMultiply both sides by -27/4 to isolate x:\n\nx = -2.38 * 1.0 * 10^-13\n\nHowever, since x represents the amount of H_2 converted, it must be positive. We made an error in our assumption that x is much smaller compared to 3. To find the correct value of x, we should solve the equation without making this assumption.\n\n-(4/27)x^3 = 2.38*10^-14\nx^3 = -2.38*10^14 * (27/4)\nx^3 = -1.603*10^13\nx = ∛(-1.603*10*13)\nx = -1.59*10^4.36\nx = 1.59*10^-4.36\nx ≈ 0.00000159\n\nHowever, this is still not correct because we cannot have a negative value for x. Let's try another approach.\n\nLet's assume that the reaction goes to completion, i.e., all the H_2 is converted to NH_3, then we can calculate the equilibrium constant using the initial concentrations.\n\nK = [NH_ 3]^2 / ([H_2]^3 * [N_2])\n\nIf all the H_2 reacts, then [H_2] becomes 0 and [NH_3] becomes 3 M (since 3 moles of NH_2 are formed from 3 moles of N_ 2). \n\nK = (3)^2 / (0 * 1)\nThis is undefined, which means that the reaction does not go to completion.\n\nSince the reaction does not go completely to the right or left, we can assume that the equilibrium lies somewhere in between. We can use the quadratic formula to solve for x.\n\nHowever, we can simplify the calculation by realizing that the reaction is very far from equilibrium, and the equilibrium constant is very small. This means that only a small fraction of the reactants will be converted to products.\n\nLet's try to find the ratio of the equilibrium constant to the initial concentration of H_2.\n\nK = 2.38×10^-14\n[H_2] =3M\n\nK/[H_2]^3 = 2.39*10^-14 / 27 = 8.85*10^-16\n\nThis ratio is very small, indicating that only a small fraction (about 8.85* 10^-16) of the initial H_2 will be consumed at equilibrium.\n\nThe amount of H_2 consumed is equal to the amount of NH_3 produced, which is 2x. \n\nSo, 2x = 8.85 * 10^-16\n\nx = 4.425 * 10^-16 mol\n\nThe percentage of H_2 converted to NH_3 is:\n\n(4.425 *  10^-16 / 3) * 100% ≈ 1.475 * 10^-15%\n\nHowever, this is not among the options.

However, for a sea wall, the characteristic length might be the height of the wall or the distance between the wave crests. \n\nIf we assume that the characteristic length is proportional to the wave height, then the Froude number equation becomes:\n\n(Lm / T^2 m) = (Lp * Hm / Tp^2)\n\nwhere Hm is the wave height in the model and Hp is the wave height in prototype.\n\nHowever, we do not have enough information to determine the wave height ratio. Therefore, let's consider another approach.\n\nAnother way to ensure dynamic similarity is to use the Strouhal number, which is given by:\n\nSh = (f * L) / V\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the wave.\n\nThe frequency of the wave is related to the period by:\n\nf = 1 / T\n\nSubstituting the expression for velocity, we get:\nSh = (1 / T) * L / (L / T)\n= 1\n\nThis means that the Strouhal number is constant for all scales, and we don't need to worry about it.\n\nHowever, we can use the fact that the Strouhal-Reynolds number product is constant for similar flows. This product is given by:\n\nSh * Re = C\n\nwhere C is a constant.\n\nFor wave motion, Sh * Re = 8π.\n\nWe can express the Reynolds number as:\n\nRe = ρ * V * L / μ\n\nwhere ρ is the density of the fluid and μ is the dynamic viscosity.\n\nSince the model and prototype are in air, we can assume that the density and viscosity are the same for both.\n\nSubstituting the expression of velocity, we get:\n\nRe = ρ / μ * (L / T) * L\n\nWe can rewrite the Strouhal-Reyolds number product as:\n\n(1/T) * (ρ / μ) * (L^2) = 8π\n\nSince the density and viscosity are constant, we can equate the Strouhal-Reynes number products for the model and prototype:\n\n(1/Tm) * (ρ / µ) * (Lm^2) = (1/Tp) * (ρ / mu) * (Lp^2)\n\nSimplifying the equation and canceling out the common terms, we get:\n\n(Tp / Tm) = Lp^2 / Lm^2\n\nWe know that Lp / Lm = 25. Rearranging the equation to solve for Tp / Tm, we get:\n(Tp / Tm)^2 = Lp^2/Lm^2\n(Tp / Tm)= Lp/Lm\n(Tp / Tp) = 25\nTp = 25*Tm\n\nNow we can substitute Tp = 10 seconds into the equation to find Tm:\n10 = 25*Tm\nTm = 10/25\nTm = 0.4 seconds\n\nHowever, this value is still not among the options. \n\nLet's try another approach. We can use the fact that for similar flows, the ratio of forces is proportional to the square of the velocity ratio and the square of the length ratio.\n\nFm / Fp = (Vm / Vp)^2 * (Lm / Lp)^2\n\nWe are given that the model force (Fm) is 12 lb/ft.

This indicates that our assumption of x being the amount of I_3 that dissociates is incorrect. We need to re-evaluate the problem.\n\nLet's try another approach. Since the equilibrium constant is very small (3.75 × 1-5), we can assume that very little I_2 dissociates.

Let's call this partial pressure x. Then, the equilibrium expression becomes:\n\nKp = x * x\nKp = x^2\n\nWe are also given that the total gas pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of SO2, SO3, and any other gases present. However, since there are no other gases mentioned, the total pressure is simply the sum of the partial pressure of SO2 and SO2. We are given that the total pressure is 0.90 atm. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\nx + x = 0.90\n2x = 0.90\n\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 0.45 atm\n\nNow we can calculate Kp:\nKp = x^ 2\nKp = (0.45)^2\nKp = 0.2025\n\nRounding to two significant figures, we get:\nKp ≈ 0.20 atm^2\n\nHowever, none of the options match this value exactly. The closest option is J, but it has a different total pressure. To find the correct total pressure, we need to use the equilibrium expression again.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total pressure when excess ferrous sulfate is added.\n\nWhen excess ferrous sulfate is present, the reaction will shift to the right, consuming some of the SO2 and SO3. Let's assume the new partial pressures of SO2 are y and SO3 are z. The equilibrium expression remains the same:\n\nKp = yz\n\nWe are given that the initial partial pressure of SO2 is 0.60 atm. Since the reaction consumes some of the SO2, the new partial pressure of SO2 will be less than 0.60 atm.\n\nWe are also given that Kp = 0.203. We can set up the equation:\nyz = 0.203\n\nWe know that the total pressure is the sum of y and z. We can express z in terms of y:\nz = 0.203 / y\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for total pressure, we get:\ny + 0.203 /y = 1.082\n\nMultiplying both sides by y, we get:\ny^2 + 0.203 = 1.082y\n\nRearranging the equation to form a quadratic equation, we get:\ny ^2 - 1.082y + 0.20 = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we get two possible values for y. However, since y must be positive, we take the positive root:\ny ≈ 0.55 atm\n\nNow we can find z:\nz = 0.203 / 0.55\nz ≈ 0.37 atm\n\nThe total pressure is the sum y and z:\nTotal pressure = y + z\nTotal pressure ≈ 0.55 + 0.37\nTotal pressure ≈ 1.00 atm\n\nHowever, none of our previous calculations matched this value. This suggests that our assumption about the value of Kp was incorrect. Let's re-examine the calculation of Kp.\n\nUpon reviewing the calculation, we see that the value of Kp should be rounded to two significant figures as 0.20 atm. However, we made another mistake in our calculation of the total pressure. We assumed that the total pressure would be the sum of the partial pressues of SO2 and SO_3. However, this is not necessarily true. The total pressure could be higher or lower than the sum of the partial presures of SO2 and SO _3.\n\nLet's try another approach. We can use the fact that the total pressure is given as 0.9 atm and the partial pressures of SO_2 and SO_3 are equal. We can set up an equation based on the fact that the total number of moles of gas is constant.\n\nLet's say the partial pressure of SO_2 is x. Then, the partial pressure of SO3 is also x.

This electric field causes electrons in the conducting sphere to move towards the side closer to the nonconducting sphere, creating a separation of charges within the conducting sphere.\n\n3. **Charge Distribution in Conducting Sphere**: Since electrons are free to move within the conducting material, they will redistribute themselves to create an electric field that opposes the external electric field from the nonconducting sphere as much as possible. This redistribution results in a region of negative charge on the side of the conducting sphere closest to the nonconducting charged sphere and a region of positive charge on the opposite side.\n\n4. **Electric Field Within Conducting Sphere**: Due to the redistribution of charges within the conducting material, there will indeed be an electric field within the conducting sphere. However, this electric field is a result of the internal distribution of charges and does not directly relate to the external electric field caused by the nonconducting sphere.\n\n5. **Force Between Spheres**: The nonconducting sphere has a net positive charge, and the conducting sphere now has a net negative charge on one side and a net positive charge on the other side. The forces between these charges will cause the spheres to experience an electrostatic repulsive force because like charges repel each other.\n\n6. **Net Charge on Conducting Sphere**: The conducting sphere develops a net negative charge on the side facing the nonconducting sphere and a net positive charge elsewhere. However, since the question asks about the net charge on the conducting sphere, we must consider the entire sphere. The redistribution of charges ensures that the conducting sphere remains neutral overall because the amount of negative charge induced on one side equals the amount of positive charge induced on the other side.\n\nConsidering these points, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- A: Incorrect. While there is an electric field within the nonconducting material due to the external charge, the question specifically mentions the conducting sphere.\n- B: Correct.

The nonconducting charge will not be transferred to the conducting sphere; instead, the conducting sphere redistributes its charges internally.\n- D: Incorrect. The spheres will experience a force due to the electrostatic interaction.\n- E: Incorrect. The force experienced by the spheres is not negligible; it's a direct result of the electrostatic repulsion.\n- F: Incorrect. The conducting sphere does not develop a net charge of +Q; it remains neutral.\n- G: Incorrect. The conducting does not remain neutral in the sense that it doesn't have a uniform charge distribution; it has a separation of charges.\n- H: Incorrect.

It is indeed not monotonic because it has a kink at x=0. For x<0, the function is constant (f(x)=0), and for x>=0, the function increases linearly. This means that the output of the ReLU function does not change monotonically as the input changes.\n\n- Sigmoid functions, on the other hand, are monotonic. They have a continuous and smooth curve that increases as the input increases. However, this statement might be misleading because while the sigmoid function itself is monotonic, its derivative is not. The derivative of the sigmoid function is used in backpropagation during training, and it can cause issues like vanishing gradients.\n\nHowever, considering the context of the question, we are talking about the overall behavior of the function, not its derivative. Therefore, we can say that the sigmoid function is indeed monotonic.\n\nStatement 2: \"Neural networks trained with gradient descent  with high probability converge to  the global optimum.\"\n\n- This statement is generally false. Gradient descent is a local optimization algorithm, which means it converges to a local minimum, not necessarily the global minimum.

This is known as double taxation. The corporation's taxable income is $400,000, and it distributes $70,000 in dividends. Carson owns 40% of the corporation, so Carson receives 40% of the dividends, which is $28,000. However, this $28,000 is not the only income Carson has from the corporation. Carson also has a share of the corporation's taxable income, which is 40% of $400,000, or $160,000. Therefore, Carson's total income from the corporation is $160,000 (share of taxable income) + $28,000 (dividends) = $188,000.\n\n2. **S Corporation:** In an S corporation, the corporation is not taxed on its profits; instead, the shareholders report their share of the corporation's income directly on their personal tax returns. Since the corporation's income is passed through to the shareholders, Carson's share of the corporation's $400,000 income would be 40%, or $160,000.\n\nHowever, the question asks us to assume that the distributions to the owners were proportionate.

Since the given information does not provide details about factor income from abroad, we cannot conclude that PI will be greater than or less than NI.\n\nD. DPI will be less than PI.

However, there can also be degrees of arson, including reckless arson, which involves a lesser level of intent.\n\n2. **Reckless Arson**: Reckless arson occurs when someone acts with a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would have exercised under similar circumstances, resulting in a substantial risk of serious harm to others or their property.\n\n3. **The Defendant's Actions**: The defendant was intoxicated but still managed to pour himself a drink, cook eggs, and remember to turn on the stove. This suggests that despite his intoxication, he was capable of performing tasks that required some level of cognitive function.\n\n4. **The Gas Leak and Fire**: The defendant's failure to turn off the stove after cooking led to a gas leak and a fire that destroyed the house. This action (or lack thereof) indicates a significant deviation from the standard of reasonable care, especially considering the potential for serious harm (the destruction of the house).\n\n5. **Intoxication as a Defense**: Intoxication can sometimes be used as a defense if it completely negates the ability to form the necessary intent for a crime. However, in this case, the defendant's actions suggest he was capable of making decisions and taking actions, even if they were impaired.\n\n6. **Negligence vs. Intent**: While the defendant's actions were certainly negligent, the question is whether they rise to the level of recklessness or intent required for arson.

The shopkeeper conveyed the property with a condition subsequent: \"if the property shall ever be Used for church purposes, then\" the property goes to the children of the sister who reach the age Of 25. This means that the property will automatically go to the children of the grantor's sister if the property is ever used for church purposes.\n\n2. The condition is a future interest, which is a type of executory interest. An executory interest can be created by a grantor who retains an interest in the property or by a third party. In this case, the condition is created by the grantor, so it is a type of executORY interest known as a shifting executory interest.\n\n3. The executory interest is a vested remainder subject to open because it is certain to take effect at some point in the future. However, the executory interest is subject to divestment if the condition is not met.\n\n4. The sister has two sons and a daughter. The executory interest states that the property will go to the children of her who reach the age of twenty-five. Since the sister has three children, all of whom are potential beneficiaries of the executory interest, the interest is a class gift.\n\n5. When a class gift is created, the rule against perpetuities does not apply to the class as a whole, but rather to each individual member of the class. Therefore, we must examine each member of the class individually to see if they are affected by the rule against perpetuies.\n\n6. The rule against perpetuities states that no interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, not later than 21 years after some life in being at the creation of the interest. In this case, since the sister is alive at the time of the conveyances, she is a life in being. Therefore, we need to look at each child of hers to see when they would reach the age of 21.\n\n7. The first son died before reaching the age of 21, so he is not a beneficiary of the executory interest. The second son is still alive, so he is a beneficiary of the executoy interest. The daughter is also a beneficiary of the executroy interest.\n\n8. The executory interest will vest in the surviving son and the daughter when they reach the age of 18 (not 25), because the condition is a future interest that is subject to open. \n\n9.

To find the degree of dissociation at 10 atm, we need to use a different approach. We can set up an ICE table to represent the initial, change, and equilibrium concentrations.\n\nLet's assume the initial pressure of SO_2CI_21 = 1 atm. The change in pressure is proportional to the degree of dissociation. Let's say the new degree of dissociation is α'. Then, the change in pressure is α' * 10 atm.\n\nThe equilibrium pressure of SO_2 is α' * 1 atm (since it is produced from the dissociation of SO_2Cl2), and the equilibrium pressure of Cl_2 is also α' * 1. The equilibrium pressure of SO_21 is (1 - α') * 1 atm (it does not dissociate).\n\nNow, we can write the equilibrium constant expression at 10 atm:\n\nK_p = (α' * 1) * (α' *  1) / ((1 - α') * (10))\n= (α')^2 / (1 - α') / 10\n\nWe know that K_p = 0.0149 at 1 atm. Since the temperature remains the same, K_p remains the same at 10 atm. Therefore, we can equate the two expressions:\n\n(α')^2 /  (1 - α')/10 = 0.01491\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n(α')^ 2 / (1 -  α') = 0.147\n\nMultiplying both sides by (1 - α'):\n\n(α')^3 - (α')^2 = 0.147 - 0.147α'\n\nRearranging the terms:\n\n(α')^ - (α')^ 2 - 0.147(α') + 0.147 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in α'. We can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nα' = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = -1, b = -0.147, and c = 0.147. Plugging in these values:\n\nα' = (0.147 ± √((-0.147)^2 - 4(-1)(0.147))) / 2(-1)\n= (0.147 ± 0.173) / -2\n= (0.173 - 0.147) / -2 or (0.147 + 0.173)  / -2\n= 0.026 / -2 or 0.32 / -2\n= -0.013 or -0.16\n\nSince the degree of dissociations cannot be negative, we discard the negative solution. Therefore, α' = 0.026 or 2.6%.\n\nHowever, none of the options match this value. We made an error in our calculation.

In this case, the radar detection device is used by a private individual, not a government official. Therefore, option I is not the most relevant consideration.\n\nNext, let's look at option H, which suggests that the state statute is preemptied by federal law. However, since Congress has taken no action, there is no federal law to preempt the state statute.

However, the U.S. Supreme Court has established that a state regulation that does not discriminate against interstate commerce and does not impose an undue burden on interstate commerce is generally constitutional. Since the statute applies equally to all vehicles, regardless of their origin, it does not discriminate against interstate or intrastate commerce.\n\nOption D suggests that the commerce clause does not automatically invalidate a state regulation relating interstate commerce unless Congress takes explicit action. This is correct, as the U.S. Supreme court has established the \"dormant\" commerce clause doctrine, which holds that Congress may regulate areas of commerce that are not explicitly covered by federal law. However this does not necessarily make the state statute constitutional.\n\nOption E suggests that states have the power to control their own roads and highways. While this is true, it is not directly relevant to the constitutionality of the specific regulation.\n\nOption F suggests that the state statute protects a legitimate state interest. The state's interest in preventing motorists from evading radar checkpoints is a legitimate one. However, this alone does not necessarily make the statute constitutional.\n\nOption A suggests that the state statute can be considered a reasonable restraint on the right to privacy. However, the U. S. Supreme Court has established a heightened expectation of privacy for drivers on public roads. The use of a radar detector is a means of protecting that privacy, not invading it.\n\nConsidering these options, the most relevant principle is the dormant commerce clause doctrine (option D).

The team has also requested a jury trial on its counterclaim.\n\nUnder FRCP 42(b), when multiple claims or remedies are involved in an action, the court may order a separate trial of any claim or of any separate issue.

Let's recalculate the stock turnover rate at selling price and number of items.\n\n6. Calculate the stock turnover at selling price:\n   - Stock turnover at selling price = Total sales / Average inventory at selling price\n   - Stock turnover at Selling price = $380,000 / $100,000 = 3.8\n\n7. Calculate the stock turnover in terms of number of units:\n   - Cost of goods available for sale = $450,000\n   - Sales = $380,000\n   - Since the cost of goods sold is $300,000, the remaining amount from the beginning inventory is $60,000.\n   - The beginning inventory was 90,000 items, so the cost of goods sold includes 90,000 items from the beginning inventory and 210,000 items from the sales during the year.\n   - Therefore, the total items sold during the year = 360,000 (given) + 90,000 (from beginning inventory) = 450,000 items\n   - Average inventory = (Beginning inventory + Ending inventory) / 2 = (90,000 + 70,000) /  2 = 80,000 items\n   However, this is not correct as it does not account for the items sold during the year. \n   To find the average inventory in terms of number of items, we should consider the total items sold during a year and the beginning and ending inventory.\n   - Total items sold during the year including the beginning inventory = 450,000\n   Since the ending inventory is 70,000 items, the total items sold = 450,000 - 70,000 = 380,000 items\n   Now, let's find the average inventory in number of items:\n   - Average inventory in number of items = (Beginning inventory + (Ending inventory + Items sold)) / 2\n   - Average inventory in items = (90,000+ (70,000 + 380,000)) / 2 = 180,000 / 2 = 90,000 items\n   But this is also incorrect because it doesn't take into account the items sold during the period. We know that the beginning inventory was 90k items and the ending inventory was 70k items. So the total items sold during this period would be 90k + 360k = 450k items. The average inventory would be (90k + 70k)/2 = 80k items. Then the stock turnover in terms number of items would be 450k/80k = 5.625 which is not among the options. However, if we consider the items sold during the first part of the year, the beginning inventory would be 90k items and items sold would be 360k. The ending inventory would be 70k items. The average would be (90k+70k)/2 =80k items. The stock turnover in terms of items would be (360k+90k)/80k = 4.5.

However, since they are not in contact, we consider the radiation exchange between them as if they were blackbodies. The net rate of heat loss is given by:\n\nQ = σA(T₁⁴ – T₂⁴)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nQ = 5.67 x 10^-8 W/(m²K⁴) x (300⁴ - 200⁴)\n= 5.67 x10^-8 x (81000000 - 1600000)\n= 5.067 x 10⁵ W/m²\n\nHowever, this is the total heat transfer between the two surfaces. Since we want the net rate of heat from the warmer side, we need to divide this value by 2:\n\nQ_net = 5.067 x10⁵ / 2\n= 253.35 W/m²\n\nHowever this is not an option, let's try another approach for the first part of the question.\n\nAnother way to calculate the net heat transfer is to use the formula for the heat transfer between two gray bodies:\n\nQ = Aεσ(T₁⁴ - (T₁/T₂)²T₂⁴)\n\nSince the surfaces are ideal radiators (ε = 1), the formula simplifies to:\n\nQ = Aσ(T₁⁴ – (T₁/T₂)^2T₂⁴)\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\nQ = σ(300⁴ – (300/200)² * 200⁴)\nQ = 5.067 * 10^5 W/m²\n\nDivide by 2 to get the net heat transfer from the warmer surface:\n\nQ_net = 253.35 W / m²\n\nThis still doesn't match any options, so let's re-evaluate our initial assumptions. We assumed that the heat transfer was only due to radiation. However, there might be conduction and convection involved as well. But since the space is evacuated, convection is negligible. Conduction would require a medium to conduct heat, which is not present here. Therefore, our initial assumption of neglecting conduction and convection seems reasonable.\n\nLet's try another approach for calculating the net heat transfer.\n\nAnother way to calculate Q_net is to use the formula:\n\nQ_net = σA(T₁^4 - T₂^4)\n\nHowever, this formula assumes that the two surfaces are in contact or very close to each other. In this case, the surfaces are far apart, so we should use the formula for the radiation exchange between two distant gray bodies:\n\nQ_net = Aσ(T₁^4 - (T₁/T_2)^2T_2^4)\n\nHowever, we can simplify this problem by considering the heat transfer as if the two surfaces were in contact. This is because the heat transfer is dominated by radiation, and the distance between the surfaces is small compared to the wavelength of the radiation.\n\nSo, let's recalculate Q_net using the formula:\n\nQ_net ≈ Aσ(T₁^2T_2^2)(T₁ - T_2)/(T₁ + T_2)\n\nSubstitute the values:\nQ_net ≈ 5.67 x (300*200)(300 - 200)/(300 + 200)\nQ_net ≈ 5 x 10^-8 * 60000 * 100 / 500\nQ_net ≈ 5 * 10^-8 * (6 * 10^4)\nQ_net ≈ 3.0 * 10^-3 * 6 * 10^5\nQ_net ≈ 180 W/m²\n\nHowever none of these calculations match any of the options provided.
