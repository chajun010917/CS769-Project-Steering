This means that our calculation is correct but the options provided do not include the calculated value. However, we can calculate the amount of air needed to reach the desired pressure by finding the difference between the final volume and the initial volume.\\n\\nAmount of air needed = V2 - V1\\nAmount of air needed = 85.71 - 1500\\nAmount of air needed ≈ -1414.29 in^3\\n\\nSince we cannot have a negative volume, this indicates that the initial volume is greater than the final volume. This means that some air will be released when the pressure is increased from 20.0 lb/ in^2 to 35.0lb/in^2. \\n\\nHowever, if we look at the options, we see that they all represent volumes of air added to the tire. Therefore, we should consider the absolute value of the difference between the final and initial volumes.\\n\\nAmount of air needed (absolute) = |V2 - V1|\\nAmount of air needed (abs) = |85.71 -  1500|\\nAmount of air needed(abs) = 1414.29 in ^3\\n\\nNone of the options match this value either.
